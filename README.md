# Ai-Parking-Space-management-system

## Overview
The AI-Driven Parking Lot Management System is a real-time solution designed to automate vehicle number plate detection, recognition, and parking fee calculation. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques with OpenCV, an interactive interface with Streamlit, and a robust PostgreSQL database, this system offers an efficient and automated approach to managing parking lots.

## Key Features
* Real-Time Video Processing: Captures video input and processes frames to detect and recognize vehicle number plates.
* Interactive Interface: Streamlit-based UI for real-time video display and data visualization.
* Database Integration: Stores entry and exit times, calculates parking duration and fees using PostgreSQL.
* Automated Fee Calculation: Calculates parking fees based on duration using predefined rules.
## Technologies Used
* Python: Backend logic and integration.
* OpenCV: Real-time video capture and number plate recognition.
* Streamlit: User interface for video display and data management.
* PostgreSQL: Database for storing vehicle entry/exit data and calculating fees.
* easyOCR: Optical Character Recognition for reading number plate text.
